            <h1>About Us</h1>
              <p>
                The iPhone is a line of touchscreen-based smartphones<br>
                designed and marketed by Apple Inc. that use Apple iOS mobile operating system. The first-<br>
                generation iPhone was announced by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then<br>
                Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates. As of November 1, 2018, more<br>
                than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold. The iPhone user interface is built around a multi-<br>
                screen with a virtual keyboard. The iPhone connects to cellular networks or Wi-Fi, and can <br>
                make calls, browse the web, take pictures, play music and send and receive emails and text<br>
                messages. Since the iPhone launch further features have been added, including larger screen <br>
                sizes, shooting video, waterproofing and the ability to install third-party mobile apps through<br>
                an app store, as well as accessibility support. Up to 2017, iPhones used a layout with a single <br>
                button on the front panel that returns the user to the home screen. Since 2017, more expensive <br>
                iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front screen design with app switching <br>
                activated by gesture recognition. The first-generation iPhone was described as revolutionary and <br>
                a game-changer for the mobile phone industry and subsequent models have also garnered <br>
                praise. The iPhone has been credited with popularizing the smartphone and slate form factor, and<br>
                with creating a large market for smartphone apps, or  economy. As of January 2017,<br>
                Apple App Store contained more than 2.2 million applications for the iPhone. The iPhone is one of<br>
                the two largest smartphone platforms in the world alongside Google Android, forming a large<br>
                part of the luxury market. The iPhone has generated large profits for Apple, making it one of the<br>
                world most valuable publicly traded companies.
